# rt 4: Recursive ray tracing

At some point we were going to get past simple Blinn-Phong shading.

rt 4 implements reflection, refraction, [Beer's law][beer] and [Schlick's approximation][schlick] so we can have transparent dielectric and conducting materials.

A metal ball with reflectance <0.9 0.9 0.9> and a glass ball with η = 1.05. Note the reflection on the side of glass ball- an effect of [Fresnel reflection][fresnel].

Two glass plates and a ball.

Horse, cube and glass mug. Implementing a [SAH][sah] on the BVH seemed to help here. Maximum recursion depth is 6 which enables up to 2<sup>6</sup> auxiliary rays per camera ray.

Conductive killeroo models, first with reflectance 0.5, then with 1.

Glass killeroo, interesting refraction patterns. η = 1.1.
