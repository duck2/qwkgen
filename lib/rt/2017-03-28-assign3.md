# rt 3: Bounding volume hierarchy

We are not supposed to wait an hour for a 30K triangle mesh to render.

Acceleration structures help with that. In our case, we maintain a [hierarchy of boxes][bwiki] into which we stuff objects. If a ray does not touch a box, there is no point checking the ray against anything in the box.

This happens to rule out lots of objects, reducing our 2700s horse_instanced.png to 16s with a simple textbook BVH, multithreading enabled.

![dragon](dragon.png)

The dragon model, 870K triangles. This chalkdragon is rendered in 39s. If we extrapolate from horse, this would have taken 13 hours to render.

![killeroo](killeroo.png)

Killeroo, 92K triangles. Took only 2.6s to render since the [viewing frustum][frust] is mostly empty.

I think the dragon is nice and deserves a material other than chalk.

![dragon_rose](dragon_rose.png)

Metallic dusty rose, like the old flip phones. took 30s

Rendering times are on a [i3-3217U][cpu-bmark].
