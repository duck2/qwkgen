# qwkgen

qwkgen is a set of tools cobbled together to statically generate a personal blog.

qwkgen is not planned to be especially configurable or extensible, however I believe it will be simple enough to maintain a personal fork.

[werc][0]'s template.awk is used as the template language.
a fork of [libsoldout][1] is used as the markdown engine.
